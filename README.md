The project aims on the detection of colours . Any colours of personal choice can be included , for the case of testing Green,Blue and Yellow are been included.
When a specific colour is identified, it forms a quadrilateral shape around the region and underneath the shape, name of the colour is specified.
The number of colours in the model has been limited to make sure that testing becomes easy.
